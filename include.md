## Introduction

This Shiny App plots all Airbnb listing in Switzerland in the beginning of 2017 (see Tab "Airbnb Map"). You can choose to filter four different dimensions:
* Room type
* Person Capacity
* Nr. of reviews
* Price per person and night

The Airbnb listings in the plot are colored by price per person and night. Please note that these prices do not include service fees.

The range sliders for **capacity**, **nr. of reviews** and **price** are inclusive, i.e. the minimum and maximum values are included in the plot.
